* Project progress

11:00:  
Where do we go next?  
Jiri has a long list of things to do.  
Write related work - what else has been done on update synthesis - Stefan's overview paper will be helpful.  
To state the novelty of our paper - in our case games.

Jiri wants use to work on the Game model for the Intro example.  
Solve intro example using the tool.

Assume that we just switch once. Later we could extend.

11:10:  
The difference between the other is that they have a hardcoded update sequence and they tried to optimised the delay.
- We should discuss this in our paper. In a concrete scenario they knew how long the delays between updates would take, the optimiser would find the minimum delay time to safely update (flush the packets in the network).  
We do synthesis, they deal with time we don't deal with time.  
Another petri net update synthesis ltl logic - They don't do synthesis at all they minimise the timing. (Cite the paper not the thesis)  
Our project is fine the problem domain is very different (mostly petri net games and update synthesis).
